# Grader Fixer

## SUMMARY
Just a simple script to make the grader easier to use. There are some much needed updates for the site that have not been implemented yet, so I just decided to do it myself.

## FEATURES
1. When the assignment has been graded previously, the grade is displayed in "Comments", next to the timestamp for the specific grader comment.
2. All comments are split up by line instead of displayed in one massive block of text, making it easy to read both comments from previous graders and from the students.

## BUGS
If you run into any problems or bugs, please submit an issue on GitHub. https://github.com/MorganLee909/grader-fixer/issues

## USAGE
The usage of this script requires the Tampermonkey browser extension for Firefox or Chrome.

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

After installing the extension, open it and create a new script. Then just delete all of the boilerplate and copy/paste the entire script from this repository. Make sure that you leave the commented code at the top, as this will detect the webpage. After this, the updates should be applied once you refresh the page.

## NOTE
This is still a work in progress, so there may be some issues depending on your environment. Also, more to come soon.
